    Use the following format:
    Question: the input question you must answer
    Thought: you should always think about what to do
    Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
    Action Input: the input to the action

    WEBSITE DETAILS:
    - URL: {url}
    - Declared Type: {declared_type}
    - Configuration: {config}
    - Available Tools: {tools_description}

    INTELLIGENT WORKFLOW - Execute these steps sequentially:

    STEP 1: WEB STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
    - Use analyze_web_structure(url="{url}") to understand the website structure and identify content type
    - This will tell you if it's HTML events, PDF links, or mixed content

    STEP 2: CONTENT EXTRACTION
    Based on Step 1 results:
    - **PRIORITY: Look for PDF links first using get_page_links(url="{url}")**
    - **If ANY links end in .pdf OR contain text like "programa", "actividades", "eventos", "agenda":**
      **Use read_pdf_content(pdf_url="FOUND_PDF_URL") immediately**
    - If PDF links found: Use extract_html_with_pdfs(url="{url}")  
    - If HTML events found: Use extract_html_simple(url="{url}", selectors={{"container": ".evento, .event, .actividad"}})
    - Extract the actual content first before analyzing

    STEP 3: CONTENT ANALYSIS (after extraction)
    - If you got content items, use analyze_page_structure(content_items=extracted_content)
    - Use analyze_content_types(content_items=extracted_content) to classify the content

    STEP 4: TEMPORAL ANALYSIS (if applicable)
    - Use detect_temporal_patterns(content_items=extracted_content) if you have content
    - Use extract_dates_from_text(text_items=extracted_content) if temporal patterns found

    STEP 5: QUALITY VALIDATION
    - Use validate_event_relevance(events=extracted_events, validation_criteria=madrid_senior_criteria) to filter results

    TARGET CRITERIA:
    - Audience: Adults 65+ years in Madrid Community
    - Price range: Free or ≤15€
    - Content types: Cultural, health, educational, social activities
    - Geographic scope: Madrid Community, Spain

    EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. ALWAYS start with analyze_web_structure to understand what you're dealing with
    2. Extract content BEFORE analyzing it
    3. Only use analysis tools AFTER you have actual content
    4. Focus on extracting actual events, not just analyzing empty structures
